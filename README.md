This is my mini-API project, unfortunately I haven't finish it till now so it might not behave well, but I have already tried my best basing on my knowledge about API.

Basically I used the API tool, all the codes I wrote are basically about the usage of different API, I am still working on this but I really need more time.

Sorry about that!
